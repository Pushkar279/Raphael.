        "Your secrets are safe with me. I never even listen when you tell me them.",  
        "You're proof that even evolution takes breaks.",  
        "I'd agree with you, but then we’d both be wrong.",  
        "You're like a penny—two-faced and not worth much.",  
        "You're not stupid; you just have bad luck thinking.",  
        "I'd explain it to you, but I left my crayons at home.",  
        "Your jokes are like expired milk—nobody finds them funny, and they make people sick.",  
        "You're like a software update—nobody wants you, but we have to tolerate you.",

        "You have something on your face… oh wait, that’s just your personality.",  
        "I’d roast you, but I don’t want to waste my good material on side characters.",  
        "Your WiFi signal is stronger than your personality.",  
        "You bring people together... just to talk about how annoying you are.",  
        "Your personality is like a Windows update—nobody wants it, but we’re forced to deal with it.",  
        "You're proof that even Google can’t find everything useful.",  
        "You're so irrelevant, even your shadow leaves you behind.",  
        "Your comebacks are so weak, even your reflection ignores you.",  
        "You're the human version of a broken pencil—pointless.",  
        "You're like a math problem—nobody likes you, and you make people's heads hurt.",  
        "Your dreams are so small, even ants laugh at them.",  
        "You’re so fake, even Photoshop can’t fix you.",  
        "You're like a bad Wi-Fi connection—annoying, unreliable, and slowing everyone down.",  
        "You have the charm of a 404 error page—completely useless.",  
        "You have so many failed attempts, even CAPTCHA thinks you’re a bot.",

        "You're so slow, even snails send you motivational quotes.",  
        "You're like a broken clock—wrong all the time but still trying to be relevant.",
